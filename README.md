# seeing_eye
The Seeing Eye is a wearable system designed to collect information about obstacles in a blind person's path. This information
can then be mapped to an extension to provide alerts to the wearer, allowing greater independence.

The code has been adapted to work with a system comprising three or five ultrasonic sensors.

This code is written in Arduino.
